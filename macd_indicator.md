# MACD Indicator
- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend following indicator that highlights the relationship between moving averages of a financial instrument.  
- The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. From the MACD line, a 9-day EMA creates the signal line.  
- The signal lie functions as a trigger to enter or exit a market, enter when MACD line crosses above signal line and short when MACD line crosses below the signal line.
